05. Explain the different kinds of relations between tables in realationl databas
  The different types of relationships between tables is called multiplicity.By using relationships we avoid
repeating data in the database.There are three main kinds of relationships(mutiplicity)
- one-to-many - a single record in the first table has multiple corresponding records in the second table. Foe 
example one country has many towns in it
- many-to-many - records in the first table have many corresponding records in the second table and vice versa.This
relationship is implemeted through an additiona table which usaly holds the related tales' primary keys as columns.
For example one student can be visting many courses and vice versa one course can be visited by many students.
- one-to-one - a single record in the frst table corresponds to a single record in the second table.This
multiplicity is ususally used to model inheritance between tables.For example a (base class) table Persons can have
corresponding(inhereted) table Proffesors which primary keys are at the same time foreign and primary keys for 
Persons, meaning that a certain person can be a proffesor only once.And a second table Students(also inheriting 
Persons) whith primart keys corresponding to the Persons' table records primary kyes, meaning a single perosn can 
be a student only once.
Hierarchical reltionships can be represented with self relationships. The primary/foreign key point to a record 
in the same table.For example representing the hierarchy of a file system holding folders and subfolders. If root 
has id: 1 and it has folder with id:2 in itself and folder has picture with id:3 withinn, we could represet the
self-relatons with a column of foreign keys representing the parent ids(primary keys). Thus folder has foreign key 
1 pointing to root and picture has foreign key 2 pointing to folder.
