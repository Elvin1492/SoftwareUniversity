06 - What is a certain database schema normalizations?
 Normalization is the process of organizing and modifying the tables in a relational database to minimize
 data redundancy.This is achieved by refactoring a table into smaller ones but without losing information, 
 by defining foreign keys in the old table referring the primary keys of the new ones extracted.
 The main advantage of database normalization is avoiding repeated data.By isolating data in this way 
 further addition, deletion and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then 
 changes will automatically be applied to data in the corresponding tables propagating through the database
 using the previously assigned foreign keys.
